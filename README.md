# Project Spanda – Conscious Multimodal Assistant (Ongoing)

Project Spanda is an ongoing, privacy-first AI assistant designed to support self-awareness and reflection without outsourcing human judgment to AI. 

The problem it addresses is the growing reliance on AI for decision-making; Spanda instead uses AI as a bridge between technology and psychology, helping users remain conscious, engaged, and self-directed.

I am designing the 
- modular architecture,
- state-managed agent workflows,
- and a voice-first reflection engine with structured stages (check-in, reflection, tuning, planning, closure).
- I am implementing local LLM integration using Ollama,
- intelligent fallback reasoning,
- consent-based short- and long-term memory,
- and neutral session summaries generated strictly from the user’s own words.
- Ongoing work includes extensible RAG-based memory,
- profile-driven personalization,
- and safety-bounded updates that avoid implicit behavioral inference.

The system prioritizes transparency, user agency, and human-in-the-loop design over full automation.
